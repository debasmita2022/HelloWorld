Chose pytest for testing due to its simplicity and popularity.
Dockerized the application to ensure consistency across different environments

Wrote unit tests to ensure the correctness of the endpoints.
Containerized the application using Docker for portability and easy deployment.
Building and Running:
Build the Docker image: docker build -t [imagename]
