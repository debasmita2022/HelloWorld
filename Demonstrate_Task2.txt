To demonstrate the application code's stability and adherence to best practices with concrete evidence, you can follow these steps:

1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
-------------------------------------

Automated Code Checks:

a. Linting:
============
Linters are programs that advise about code quality by displaying warnings and errors.
They can detect your Python code mistakes, notice invalid code patterns and find elements that do not follow your conventions.

Use a popular linting tool like Flake8(for Python) depending on the language.
Configure linting rules to follow industry best practices and coding standards.
Integrate linting into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check code during each build.

b. Unit Tests:
==============

Write comprehensive unit tests for your code using a testing framework suitable for your programming language (pytest for Python).
Integrate unit tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure they are executed on each code change.
Aim for high code coverage to validate the effectiveness of your tests.

c. Documentation:
=================

Keep code documentation up-to-date using tools like Google Docs,Doxygen etc.
Maintain a clear and detailed README.md file in your repository explaining how to set up, run tests, and contribute to the project.
Follow a consistent and well-documented coding style.

2. Containerization:
--------------------

Docker Container Checks:

a. Dockerfile:
--------------
Write a Dockerfile adhering to best practices, such as using lightweight base images, minimizing layers, and specifying versions for dependencies.
Use docker-compose for multi-container applications and define the services accordingly.

b. Security Scanning:
---------------------
Integrate a container security scanning tool like Clair  into your CI/CD pipeline to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
Regularly update base images and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

c. Container Orchestration
---------------------------
If applicable, demonstrate the ability to deploy and scale your application using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
Provide Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for easy deployment

3. CI/CD Configuration:
a. CI/CD Definitions:

Include CI/CD configuration files (Jenkinsfile) in the root of your Git repository.
Define stages for linting, testing, building, and deploying the application.

b. Automated Deployment:

If applicable, automate the deployment process in the CI/CD pipeline.
Use environment-specific configuration to deploy to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

c. Notifications and Reports:

Configure notifications for CI/CD pipeline status, sending emails or messages in case of failures.
Generate and publish reports after each CI/CD run to provide insights into test results and code quality metrics.

4. Documentation:
a. CI/CD Setup Documentation:

Include documentation on how to set up the CI/CD pipeline locally for developers.
Detail the CI/CD workflow, including the stages, jobs, and dependencies.

b. Contribution Guidelines:

Document guidelines for contributing to the project, including the process for submitting pull requests, coding standards, and testing requirements.
By implementing these practices and including relevant configuration files and documentation in your Git repository, you can provide concrete evidence of your application's stability and adherence to best practices. This approach ensures that automated checks are consistently applied, contributing to the overall quality and reliability of your codebase.
